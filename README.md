# FreeCodeCamp Markdown Editor

The FreeCodeCamp challenge is to [Build a Markdown Previewer](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer).

1. **User Story:** I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
2. **User Story:** I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
